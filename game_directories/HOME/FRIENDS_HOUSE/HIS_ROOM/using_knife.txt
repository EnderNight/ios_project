My heart races as I realize what I have to do. I raise my weapon, my hand shaking with fear and grief, and take a step
towards the zombie that was once my friend. I hesitate for a moment, but then I remember that there is no turning back
now. I close my eyes and swing the knife with all my might, the sound of metal hitting flesh echoing through the room.

I open my eyes and see that the zombie is still standing, but it's not moving anymore. It's just standing there, staring
at me with its dead eyes. I feel sick to my stomach and drop the knife, which clatters to the floor. I turn around and
run out of the room, with tears streaming down my face. I know there was no other choice, but it still hurts so much.

There is noting else to do here.
