As I set out from my home towards my friend's house, I can't help but feel a sense of unease.
The world around me is so different now, so much more dangerous than it once was. I grip myself,
ready to defend myself against any threat that may come my way.

The streets are eerily quiet, save for the occasional groan of a distant zombie. I move quickly,
keeping to the shadows and trying to avoid drawing attention to myself. As I move through the abandoned streets,
I can't help but feel a sense of sadness at the state of the world around me. Buildings that were once bustling
with life now lie in ruins, their windows shattered and their walls crumbling.

As I approach my friend's house, I can see that it has not escaped the destruction. The front door is hanging
off its hinges, and the windows are smashed. I enter the house, and call out to my friend. There is no response.

I could either investigate the first floor, or head upstairs to the second floor.

What should I do?
