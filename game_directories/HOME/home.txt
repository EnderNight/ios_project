As the protagonist cautiously steps out of his building, he is met with a sight of utter chaos and destruction.
The once peaceful village that he called home is now unrecognizable. Buildings that once stood tall are now reduced to rubble,
their walls and roofs destroyed by what appears to be the work of a frenzied mob.

The air is thick with the stench of decay, and the sounds of moaning and growling can be heard in the distance.
The protagonist knows all too well what this means - the zombie apocalypse has finally arrived.

The streets are littered with debris, overturned cars and abandoned possessions, evidence of the panic that
ensued as the zombies first began to attack. As he surveys the scene before him, the protagonist can't help but feel
a sense of despair - how could this have happened? How could humanity have allowed things to get this bad?

But there is no time for dwelling on these thoughts. The protagonist knows that he needs to act fast if he is to survive.
He grips his trusty knife tightly, the weight of it reassuring in his hand. He takes a deep breath and sets off down the street,
his eyes scanning the surroundings for any sign of danger.

I think i should go to the east, approaching like this to the edges of the city, but my friend's house is at the west.
What should i do?
