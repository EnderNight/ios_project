When a reach the parking, the worst suspicion that I have becomes true. My car is indeed there, but the
front side is destroyed, and the battery is missing. If I want to use it to get out of here, I will have
to repair it first. I have no idea where a new battery could be found, but I know that I can repair the
car if I find one. I will have to search for it.
