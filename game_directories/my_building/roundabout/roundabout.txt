I approach the roundabout. I see a barricade made by cars, that is apparently blocking the way out of the city.
The police looks to have the situation under control here, but the ambience is still tense. I can see a few people in
the crowd that are armed with guns, and I can see a few police officers with their guns drawn as well.

I might be able to get through the barricade, but I think I should try to find another way out of the city first, or
at least, try to get something to convince the police to let me through.

I can go back to my building, go to the parking to check the state of my car or keep going forward to the end of the
street. I reckon there was a mall at the end there.
