The state of the mall looks as if it was abandoned in a hurry. There are still some items on the shelves, but most of
them are broken or damaged. All the shops are abandoned, and the only thing I can hear is the sound of my own footsteps.

Besides, I can't see any zombies around. It's like they all disappeared. I don't know if it's a good thing or not. If I
want to keep going up in the mall, I must start being very careful.
