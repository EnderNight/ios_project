When I reach the second floor, the whole place looks even more abandoned than the first floor. There are no lights on,
and the only thing I can see is the moonlight coming through the windows.

When I see the group of zombies in the middle of the room, I feel fortunate to bring my friend's flamethrower with me.
I switch it on, and the zombies are burned to ashes in a matter of seconds. I feel a bit sorry for them, but I know
that they would have killed me if I hadn't killed them first.

Now I have clear path to go to the 3rd floor.
