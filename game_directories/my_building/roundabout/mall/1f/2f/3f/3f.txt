The third floor of the shopping mall in a post-apocalyptic world presents a haunting scene of desolation and decay.
Broken glass and fallen debris cover the tiled floor, remnants of a time long gone. The once vibrant storefronts now
stand abandoned and boarded up, with their faded signs barely legible.

Among the remaining establishments, I miraculously find what I was looking for. There are car parts scattered on the
floor, likely from one that was on display before this incident. Among the wreckage of the car and the stores,
I find the battery I was looking for.
