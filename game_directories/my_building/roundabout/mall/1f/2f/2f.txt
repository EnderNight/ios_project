When I reach the second floor, the whole place looks even more abandoned than the first floor. There are no lights on,
and the only thing I can see is the moonlight coming through the windows.

Besides, now I understand where all the zombies went. They are all here, guarding the stairs that lead to the third
floor. I can't see any other way to go up, so I must fight them if I want to keep going. For doing this, I will need to
use a crowed control weapon. But, where do I find something like that?
