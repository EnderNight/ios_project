I wake up, and as I cautiously step out of my building, I am met with a sight of utter chaos and destruction.
The once peaceful village that I called home is now unrecognizable. Buildings that once stood tall are now
reduced to rubble, their walls and roofs destroyed by what appears to be the work of a frenzied mob.

There is no time for dwelling on these thoughts. I need to act fast if I want to survive, so i take a deep breath and set off down the street,
with my eyes scanning the surroundings for any sign of danger.

I think I should go to the east, approaching like this to the edges of the city, but my friend's house is at the west.
I didn't park my car far from here either, so I could go north and try to get it, but I don't know if it will
remain intact after all this destruction.
