I wake up, and as I cautiously step out of my building, I am met with a sight of utter chaos and destruction.
The once peaceful village that I called home is now unrecognizable. Buildings that once stood tall are now
reduced to rubble, their walls and roofs destroyed by what appears to be the work of a frenzied mob.

There is no time for dwelling on these thoughts. I need to act fast if I want to survive, so I take a deep breath and set off down the street,
with my eyes scanning the surroundings for any sign of danger.

On the one hand, I think I should go west, approaching like this to the roundabout My car is near there and I should
go check it as well, but I don't know if it will remain intact after all this destruction.

On the other hand,  my friend's house is at the west. He was some kind of survivalist, so he might have some supplies
that could help me survive this mess.
