I set out from my home towards my friend's house.

The streets are eerily quiet. I move quickly, keeping to the shadows and trying to avoid drawing attention to myself.
As I move through the abandoned streets,
I can't help but feel a sense of sadness at the state of the world around me. Buildings that were once bustling
with life now lie in ruins, their windows shattered and their walls crumbling. The world around me is so different
now, so much more dangerous than it once was. I grip myself, ready to defend myself against any threat that may come my way.

As I approach my friend's house, I can see that it has not escaped the destruction. The front door is hanging
off its hinges, and the windows are smashed. I enter the house, and call out to my friend. There is no response.

I could either investigate the first floor, or head upstairs to the second floor.
