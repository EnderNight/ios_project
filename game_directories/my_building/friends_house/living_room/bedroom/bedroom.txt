Taking a deep breath, I decide to head upstairs to the second floor. The stairs creak beneath my feet as I ascend,
and I can't help but feel a sense of dread at what I might find. I reach the top of the stairs and step into the hallway,
As I move towards my friend's room, I notice that the hallway is littered with debris, broken picture frames and other
remnants of the chaos that has consumed the world. The air is thick with the stench of decay. With trembling hands, I
push the door open and step inside. The room is in shambles, the furniture overturned and the walls covered in blood.

And then I see him - my friend, now dead, his eyes vacant and his body twisted into an unnatural position. But, as I was
about to leave the room, I notice something strange. His body begins to twitch, and his eyes have opened. He looks at me with
a look of pure hatred and starts moving towards me.

I might not have much time to take a decision.

What should I do?
