His room is a total mess. Chaos seems to reign here. The space is littered with various objects, creating an
untidy and disorganized atmosphere. Papers, tools, and components are scattered haphazardly across the room.

The focal point of the room is his desk, where an unusual item catches the eye. Among the clutter, there lies
a flamethrower. Its menacing presence seems out of place amidst the friend's tools, suggesting a hint of
eccentricity or a passion for unique gadgets. The desk itself is cluttered with blueprints, technical manuals,
and partially completed projects, further illustrating the engineer's scattered mindset.

I I'm glad that my friend was able to at least finish building this before turning into an undead.
Thank you so much, my friend, I will put it to good use.
