The kitchen in this house tells a unique tale of preparedness and macabre adaptation. Despite the eerie
circumstances, there is a peculiar order amidst the chaos, reflecting my friend's pragmatic approach to life.

I can see a lot of dishes in the sink, and a few on the counter. There is a large pot on the stove, and a few more
on the floor. The fridge is open, and I can see a few things inside.

As I was looking for something useful, I found a big knife. I hope I don't end up needing it.
