I can't stand this situation at all. I have to get out of here. With all my remaining might, I manage to
run out of the room and down the stairs, reaching like this the first floor.

There must be something I can still do for him. I may be missing something.

What should I do now?

Possible options:
-> SECOND_FLOOR
-> MY_BUILDING
