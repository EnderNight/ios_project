I wake up, and as I cautiously step out of my building, I am met with a sight of utter chaos and destruction.
The once peaceful village that I called home is now unrecognizable. Buildings that once stood tall are now reduced to rubble,
their walls and roofs destroyed by what appears to be the work of a frenzied mob.

The air is thick with the stench of decay, and the sounds of moaning and growling can be heard in the distance.

The streets are littered with debris, overturned cars and abandoned possessions, evidence of the panic that the population is suffering
because of unknown reasons. I can't help but feel a sense of despair - how could this have happened? How could humanity have allowed
things to get this bad?

But there is no time for dwelling on these thoughts. I need to act fast if I want to survive, so i take a deep breath and set off down the street,
with my eyes scanning the surroundings for any sign of danger.

I think I should go to the east, approaching like this to the edges of the city, but my friend's house is at the west.

What should I do now?

Possible options:
-> FRIENDS_HOUSE
-> CITY_EDGES
