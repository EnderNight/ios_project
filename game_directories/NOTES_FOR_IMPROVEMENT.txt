    1. We should start implementing links to directories inside directories, for testing purposes. (idk how to do it lol)

    2. We should contemplate the possibility of being able to open different .txt files/descriptions when reaching
       the same directory from different angles (e.g. in FRIENDS_HOUSE, there is the proper .txt file and then there
       is the one that is opened when you reach FRIENDS_HOUSE when running_away on SECOND_FLOOR)

    3. For the story to not be 0 interactive, we should implement some way of decision-making on .txt files,
       and to do so, I can think of 2 ways of implementing it:

        3.1. We print at the end of a .txt file the decisions, and each of them will be a directory.
             When entering it, a link to the proper directory will be done automatically.

             e.g (in SECOND_FLOOR.txt): RUN_AWAY. We can have a directory called RUN_AWAY, that when opened will lead to the proper
             directory, which is in this case FRIENDS_HOUSE. To implement this idea, in the ls function we can make a condition that
             checks if the entering directory only has a link to another directory, and if so, it will automatically open it.

        3.2. We leave all the possible decisions available in the same directory. For doing this, I think it will be necessary to look
             for the .txt specifically with the name of the decision, and then open it. It might be very difficult (idk).

             One thing is true, and it is that there are cases in which when we take a decision, another decision is gettable, and I think that
             this way of implementing the concept of decision-making is better in doing so (idk, again).

    4. We should create already a .h file or smt like that, to have all the global variables that are used throughout all the directories.
