story
You woke up at 13 pm and were ready to start your day. As you listen to the news you realise that you have 24 hours left before the city gets nuked.
“Sure whatever” you think.
You go outside and realize that there is not a single person around.
By the time you fully wake up, you witness bodies, blood, and fire. Nothing like usual.
Despite feeling lost and confused, you tell yourself one thing :
“I have to get out of here”
/
roundabout
I approach the edges of the city. I see a barricade made by cars, that is apparently blocking the way out of the city.
The police looks to have the situation under control here, but the ambience is still tense. I can see a few people in
the crowd that are armed with guns, and I can see a few police officers with their guns drawn as well.

I might be able to get through the barricade, but I think I should try to find another way out of the city first, or
at least, try to get something to convince the police to let me through.

I can go back to my building or keep going forward to the end of the street. I reckon there was a mall at the end
of the street.

friendhouse
I set out from my home towards my friend's house.

The streets are eerily quiet. I move quickly, keeping to the shadows and trying to avoid drawing attention to myself.
As I move through the abandoned streets,
I can't help but feel a sense of sadness at the state of the world around me. Buildings that were once bustling
with life now lie in ruins, their windows shattered and their walls crumbling. The world around me is so different
now, so much more dangerous than it once was. I grip myself, ready to defend myself against any threat that may come my way.

As I approach my friend's house, I can see that it has not escaped the destruction. The front door is hanging
off its hinges, and the windows are smashed. I enter the house, and call out to my friend. There is no response.

I could either investigate the first floor, or head upstairs to the second floor.

bedroom
Taking a deep breath, I decide to head upstairs to the second floor. The stairs creak beneath my feet as I ascend,
and I can't help but feel a sense of dread at what I might find. I reach the top of the stairs and step into the hallway,
As I move towards my friend's room, I notice that the hallway is littered with debris, broken picture frames and other
remnants of the chaos that has consumed the world. The air is thick with the stench of decay. With trembling hands, I
push the door open and step inside. The room is in shambles, the furniture overturned and the walls covered in blood.

And then I see him - my friend, now dead, his eyes vacant and his body twisted into an unnatural position. But, as I was
about to leave the room, I notice something strange. His body begins to twitch, and his eyes have opened. He looks at me with
a look of pure hatred and starts moving towards me.

I might not have much time to take a decision.
What should I do?

do_nothing
I can't move. I'm frozen in place, unable to process what I'm seeing.

While on this state, my friend approaches me and bites me in the neck.

I feel a sharp pain.
/
My heart races as I realize what I have to do. I raise my weapon, my hand shaking with fear and grief, and take a step
towards the being that was once my friend. I hesitate for a moment, but I remember that there is no turning back now.
I close my eyes and swing the knife with all my might, the sound of metal hitting flesh echoing through the room.

I open my eyes and see that he is still standing, but it's not moving anymore. It's just standing there, staring
at me with his vacant eyes. I feel sick to my stomach and drop the knife, which clatters to the floor. I turn around and
run out of the room, with tears streaming down my face. I know there was no other choice, but it still hurts so much.

There is noting else worth doing here.
