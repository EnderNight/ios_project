story
You woke up at 13 pm and were ready to start your day. As you listen to the news you realise that you have 24 hours left before the city gets nuked.
“Sure whatever” you think.
You go outside and realize that there is not a single person around.
By the time you fully wake up, you witness bodies, blood, and fire. Nothing like usual.
Despite feeling lost and confused, you tell yourself one thing :
“I have to get out of here”
/
roundabout
I approach the edges of the city. I see a barricade made by cars, that is apparently blocking the way out of the city.
The police looks to have the situation under control here, but the ambience is still tense. I can see a few people in
the crowd that are armed with guns, and I can see a few police officers with their guns drawn as well.

I might be able to get through the barricade, but I think I should try to find another way out of the city first, or
at least, try to get something to convince the police to let me through.

I can go back to my building or keep going forward to the end of the street. I reckon there was a mall at the end
of the street.

friends_house
I set out from my home towards my friend's house.

The streets are eerily quiet. I move quickly, keeping to the shadows and trying to avoid drawing attention to myself.
As I move through the abandoned streets,
I can't help but feel a sense of sadness at the state of the world around me. Buildings that were once bustling
with life now lie in ruins, their windows shattered and their walls crumbling. The world around me is so different
now, so much more dangerous than it once was. I grip myself, ready to defend myself against any threat that may come my way.

As I approach my friend's house, I can see that it has not escaped the destruction. The front door is hanging
off its hinges, and the windows are smashed. I enter the house, and call out to my friend. There is no response.

I could either investigate the first floor, or head upstairs to the second floor.

bedroom
Taking a deep breath, I decide to head upstairs to the second floor. The stairs creak beneath my feet as I ascend,
and I can't help but feel a sense of dread at what I might find. I reach the top of the stairs and step into the hallway,
As I move towards my friend's room, I notice that the hallway is littered with debris, broken picture frames and other
remnants of the chaos that has consumed the world. The air is thick with the stench of decay. With trembling hands, I
push the door open and step inside. The room is in shambles, the furniture overturned and the walls covered in blood.

And then I see him - my friend, now dead, his eyes vacant and his body twisted into an unnatural position. But, as I was
about to leave the room, I notice something strange. His body begins to twitch, and his eyes have opened. He looks at me with
a look of pure hatred and starts moving towards me.

I might not have much time to take a decision.
What should I do?
/
do_nothing
I can't move. I'm frozen in place, unable to process what I'm seeing.

While on this state, my friend approaches me and bites me in the neck.

I feel a sharp pain.
/
My heart races as I realize what I have to do. I raise my weapon, my hand shaking with fear and grief, and take a step
towards the being that was once my friend. I hesitate for a moment, but I remember that there is no turning back now.
I close my eyes and swing the knife with all my might, the sound of metal hitting flesh echoing through the room.

I open my eyes and see that he is still standing, but it's not moving anymore. It's just standing there, staring
at me with his vacant eyes. I feel sick to my stomach and drop the knife, which clatters to the floor. I turn around and
run out of the room, with tears streaming down my face. I know there was no other choice, but it still hurts so much.

There is noting else worth doing here.

living_room
The living room of this house exudes an atmosphere of cautious comfort amidst the remnants of an uncertain world.
Despite the unsettling presence, there are signs of resilience and a determination to find solace amidst disorder.

The furniture in the living room reflects a utilitarian design, with sturdy, well-worn couches and chairs arranged
strategically for ease of movement and visibility. The upholstery, though faded and threadbare, still holds traces
of the tenant's meticulous care. The room is sparsely decorated, with minimalistic touches, suggesting a focus on
practicality over aesthetics.

In spite of what might be expected coming from my friend, it seems that I won't find anything useful in this room.
/
kitchen
The kitchen in this house tells a unique tale of preparedness and macabre adaptation. Despite the eerie
circumstances, there is a peculiar order amidst the chaos, reflecting my friend's pragmatic approach to life.

I can see a lot of dishes in the sink, and a few on the counter. There is a large pot on the stove, and a few more
on the floor. The fridge is open, and I can see a few things inside.

As I was looking for something useful, I found a big knife. I hope I don't end up needing it.

investigate
His room is a total mess. Chaos seems to reign here. The space is littered with various objects, creating an
untidy and disorganized atmosphere. Papers, tools, and components are scattered haphazardly across the room.

The focal point of the room is his desk, where an unusual item catches the eye. Among the clutter, there lies
a flamethrower. Its menacing presence seems out of place amidst the friend's tools, suggesting a hint of
eccentricity or a passion for unique gadgets. The desk itself is cluttered with blueprints, technical manuals,
and partially completed projects, further illustrating the engineer's scattered mindset.

I I'm glad that my friend was able to at least finish building this before turning into an undead.
Thank you so much, my friend, I will put it to good use.

parking
When a reach the parking, the worst suspicion that I have becomes true. My car is indeed there, but the
front side is destroyed, and the battery is missing. If I want to use it to get out of here, I will have
to repair it first. I have no idea where a new battery could be found, but I know that I can repair the
car if I find one. I will have to search for it.
/
road
I use my keys, and finally hear the car start. Once and for all, I hurry to the highway through the road and
get as far away from this city as possible. I don't know where I'll go, but anywhere will do. I hope I will be okay.
/
mall
At the end of the street, I find an already abandoned mall. I can see a few people inside, but I can't tell if they are
alive or dead. At least, they don't seem to be moving.

This place is a dead end, but I might be able to find something useful here.

The state of the mall looks as if it was abandoned in a hurry. There are still some items on the shelves, but most of
them are broken or damaged. All the shops are abandoned, and the only thing I can hear is the sound of my own footsteps.

Besides, I can't see any zombies around. It's like they all disappeared. I don't know if it's a good thing or not. If I
want to keep going up in the mall, I must start being very careful.

When I reach the second floor, the whole place looks even more abandoned than the first floor. There are no lights on,
and the only thing I can see is the moonlight coming through the windows.

Besides, now I understand where all the zombies went. They are all here, guarding the stairs that lead to the third
floor. I can't see any other way to go up, so I must fight them if I want to keep going. For doing this, I will need to
use a crowed control weapon. But, where do I find something like that?
